## Tips

- **Pacing:** If you run long, shorten Leaderboard, Settings, or Future Planning.
- **Quests:** Use a short quest (fewer questions) or Skip to end to stay on time.
- **Shop:** Use a user with enough XP to redeem (e.g. adamhorvitz @ 50k).
- **Chat:** Use one short question so Penny’s reply loads quickly.
- **Rehearse** once with the checklist, then record while reading this script.
